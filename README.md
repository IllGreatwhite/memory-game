#Memory Game

##Cover:
This is the final project for the Intro to programming nanodegree. The project consists in taking a prewritten HTML and CSS, file and using
Javascript and Jquery, build a fully functional card game that ounts how many moves you have made, how many seconds have passed, a refresh button,
a star ranking system and a modal that pops up once you have won.

##How to run:
To run this program all you have to do is either download the zip file or fork the repository, once you have the files on your computer you must
double click on the index.html file which will open the game in your default browser.

##How to play:
The game is very easy to play, all you have to do is click on a card and try and match it with another. If you match two cards then they stay face up,
if you dont then they will return to their initial state. If you wish to restart at any point then feel free to hit the refrsh button a the top.

##Troubleshooting:
At time of creation the game doesnt seem to have any bugs, if I discover any then i shall fix it immediatley, also if you discover a problem
please get in touch and I will help you solve it. 

##contribution:
If you wish to use this code in your own program feel free to do so, I insist that you dont use this code if you are currently doing the project yourself,
as that is cheating and no matter how tempting its better to learn yourself than copy somebody elses work.... plus there are way better projects out there
than mine!!!
